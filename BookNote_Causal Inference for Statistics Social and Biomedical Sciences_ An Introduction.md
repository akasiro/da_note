## Chapter 1: causality: the basic framework

### 1.2 potential outcomes
+ fundamental notion: *action* applied to a *unit*
	+ From this perspective, a causal statement presumes that, although a unit was (at a particular point in time) subject to, or exposed to, a particular action, treatment, or regime, the same unit could have been exposed to an alternative action, treatment, or regime (at the same point in time).
+ 本书主要关注settings with two actions：例如吃不吃阿司匹林
+ Potential outcome的定义：
>  Given a unit and a set of actions, we associate each action-unit pair with a *potential outcome* .
>   只有一种potential outcome可能被观察到

+ 因果效应是不同potential outcomes的对比
> The causal effect of one action or treatment relative to another involves the com- parison of these potential outcomes, one realized (and perhaps, though not necessarily, observed), and the others not realized and therefore not observable.

+ 因此说清楚alternative action，有助于更清楚的定义因果问题。the explicit description of the intervention makes the question a plausible causal one in our framework
### 1.3 definition of causal effects

+ Definition of causal effects: ***the comparison of potential outcomes***
	+ 1 the definition of the causal effect ==depends on the potential outcomes==, but it does not depend on which outcome is actually observed.
	+ 2 the causal effect is ==the comparison of potential outcomes==, for the same unit, ==at the same moment== in time post-treatment.
+ ***Estimation*** of causal effects
	+ need to *compare observed outcomes*.
	+ Because only one realized ptential outcome per unit, we will need to consider multiple units.
		+ a before-and-after comparison of the same physical object involves distinct units in our framework
		+ the comparison of two different physical objects at the same time involves distinct units.
	+ need to think about the *assignment mechanism*
